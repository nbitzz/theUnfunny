# theUnfunny

An unfunny Discord bot.

## Prerequisites

`discord.js` v14, `axios`, and `typescript`. 

If you want to use the soundboard command, install `@discordjs/voice` and [its dependencies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice#dependencies). If you don't want to use the soundboard command, make sure to remove the `src/commands/soundboard.ts` file before compilation to avoid errors.
